# Note: I was only responsible for the logic. All markup and CSS was given to me as part of the challenge.


##The challenge:
When the user finishes (blur) entering a credit card number, change the credit card image to match the type of card they entered. You can add a class of `visa`, `mastercard`, `discover`, or `american` to line 16 in index.html
American Express cards always begin with the number 3- more specifically 34 or 37
Visa cards begin with the number 4.
Mastercards start with the number 5.
Discover Cards begin with the number 6.
When the user enters the CVV number, have the card flip over by adding a class of `flip` on line 16 in index.html
